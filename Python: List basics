#Preparing a LIST:
list = ["Python","Jupyter","Anaconda"]    #making a list and entering the data into list
print(list)                               #calling the list
list                                      # Here we can directly call the list with using PRINT

#Accessing Elements in a list
list = ["Python","Jupyter","Anaconda"]
print(list[0])                           #accessing the first element of a list

#Accessing Elements in a list
list = ["Python","Jupyter","Anaconda"]
print(list[2])                          #here the index position of a list starts with "0" but not with "1"



#Manipulation of al list MODIFYING ,ADDING AND REMOVING Elements:

list = ["Python","Jupyter","Anaconda"]
print(list)

#Modifying the list
list[0] = "Pcharms"                     #Here we are changing the 1st element of the list by using the index number
print(list)

#Adding the list
list.append("Eclipse")                 #Here an element has been added to the list
print(list)                                   

#Removing the list
del list[0]                            #Here the element of index position "0" has been deleted 
print(list)

#Inserting an element in a list
list.insert(0,"IDE")                   #Here we are inserting an element in a list at a particular index using the number
print(list)                            # List_Name.insert(Index_number, "Element")



#Removing elements SPECIAL CASES

#Removing elements using POP()
list = ["Python","Jupyter","Anaconda","IDE"]
list.pop(0)                           #Here using POP along with the index number in the brackets
print(list)


#Removing element using the value
list = ["Python","Jupyter","Anaconda","IDE"]
list.remove("Jupyter")
print(list)

'''The remove() method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there’s 
 a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you’ll need to use a loop 
 to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed.'''


#Organising a list using sort()
'''Python’s sort() method makes it relatively easy to sort a list. Imagine we 
have a list of cars and want to change the order of the list to store them 
alphabetically'''

l1 = ["Charlie","John","Kile","Emma"]
l1.sort()                               #By using sort() here we can arange the elements in an alphabetical order.
print(l1)


#Reverse order
l1 = ["Charlie","John","Kile","Emma"]
l1.sort(reverse=True)                   #Here we got the ouput repsonse in reverse order using BOOLEAN
print(l1)


#Sorting using sorted() function
l1 = ["Charlie","John","Kile","Emma"]
print(sorted(l1))                       #Directly we can print the sorted list using 'sorted(List_Name)'

#Reverse order of a list without any sorting method
l1 = ["Charlie","John","Kile","Emma"]
l1.reverse()                           #we can get the output as in descending order
print(l1)
